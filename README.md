TYPES OF CHARTS
1. Area Charts :
The area chart depends on line charts to display quantitative graphical data. The area between the axis and lines is commonly filled with colors, textures, and patterns. You can compare more than two quantities with area charts. It shows the trend changes over time and can be used to attract the attention of the users to know the total changes across the trends.
2. Line Charts :
Line charts are mostly used charts to represent the data and are characterized by a series of data points connected by a straight line. Each point in the line corresponds to a data value in the given category. It shows the exact value of the plotted data. Line charts should only be used to measure the trends over a period of time, e.g. dates, months, and years
3. Bar Chart :
Bar charts are simple to create and easy to understand. Bar charts are also called horizontal charts that represent the absolute data. They are useful to display the data that include negative values because it is possible to position the bars above and below the x-axis.
4. Column Charts :
Column charts are similar to bar charts, and the only difference between these two is, column chart divides the same category data into the clusters and compares within the clusters. Also, it compares the data from other clusters
5. Combo Charts :
A combo chart is a combination of both the column charts and line charts that help you to make a quicker comparison of the data. The combo chart shows the relationship between two measures in a single visualization. It also helps to compare multiple measures with different values.
6. Pie Charts : 
A pie chart is a circular statistical chart, and it shows the whole data in parts. Each portion of a pie chart represents the percentages, and the sum of all parts should be equal to 100%. The whole data can be divided into slices to show the numerical propositions of each part of the data. Pie charts are mostly used to represent the same category of data. It helps users to understand the data quickly. They are widely used in education, the business world, and communication media.
7. Doughnut Charts:
Doughnuts are similar to pie charts, and it is named doughnut chart because it looks similar to a doughnut. You can easily understand the data because doughnut charts show the whole data into the proposition. It is the most useful chart when you need to display various propositions that make up the final value.
8. Gauge Charts :
A gauge chart is also known as a speedometer or dial chart. It uses the needle to read the data, and it shows the information on a dial. The gauge chart, it represents the value of each needle as it reads the data according to the axis or colored data. These charts are useful to compare the values between the variables either by using multiple needles on the same gauge or different gauges.
9. Funnel Charts :
The funnel chart is a type of chart which is used to visualize the data that flows from one phase to another phase. In the funnel chart, the whole data is considered as 100%, and in each phase, it is represented as numerical propositions of the data.
10. Gauge Charts :
A gauge chart is also known as a speedometer or dial chart. It uses the needle to read the data, and it shows the information on a dial. The gauge chart, it represents the value of each needle as it reads the data according to the axis or colored data. These charts are useful to compare the values between the variables either by using multiple needles on the same gauge or different gauges.
11. Funnel Charts :
The funnel chart is a type of chart which is used to visualize the data that flows from one phase to another phase. In the funnel chart, the whole data is considered as 100%, and in each phase, it is represented as numerical propositions of the data.
12. Scatter Charts :
Scatter charts are used to visualize the data using the dots that represent the values obtained from two different variables, such as the x-axis and y-axis. These charts are used to show the relationship between two different variables. It is also called a correlation plot because it shows how two variables are correlated to each other. 
13. Bubble Charts :
Bubble charts show the data in the form of a circle. The values of the variables are represented by the x-axis and y-axis. The size of the circle represents the measure of the variables.
14. Waterfall Charts :
 A waterfall chart is used to show how initial values are increasing and decreasing gradually by a series of values to arrive at the final value. 
15. Maps :  
Maps are divided into three types
* Regional Maps : Regional maps use different colors to represent the distribution of a specific range of values on the map.
* Point Maps : A point map is used to represent the geographical distribution of data by plotting the same size points on the geographical background. It helps the user to grasp the overall distribution of the data, but it is a tough task if you want to observe specific data.
* Flow Maps : A flow map is a type of map that is particularly designed to show specific themes connected with a particular geographical area. It is used in cartography to show the movements of the objects between two or more areas. 
14. Slicers Charts : 
Slicers charts are visual filters. Using slicers, you can filter or sort your data by clicking on the type of data you want. In the below example, you can see all-region sales. In case if you want to see particular region sales, then click on that region, and it shows the specific region's sales. 
15. Tree Maps : 
Treemaps display hierarchical data set in a nested rectangle. At each level, hierarchy is represented by a color. The size of the space in the rectangle depends on the data values. The rectangular boxes are arranged in size from top left to bottom right.

 **Some Basic differences between important graphs**
 
|Bar chart | Column chart|
|----------|--------------------|
|Horizontal  Orientation | Vertical orientation |

|Stacked |100 % Stacked|Clustered|
|-------|--------|--------|
|Parts to Whole Comparison: Stacked bar charts are ideal for visualizing the composition of a whole across different categories. Each bar represents the total, and segments within the bar represent the proportion of each category.|Relative Proportions: 100% stacked bar charts are used when you want to compare the relative proportions of different categories across groups or time period. |Comparison Between Groups: Clustered bar charts are used to compare values between different groups for the same categories. Each group has its own set of bars, and bars within the same group are clustered together.|
|Limited Number of Categories: Stacked bar charts work well with a relatively small number of categories to prevent clutter and maintain clarity.|Normalization: These charts normalize the data, making it easier to compare the distribution of categories across different groups or time periods, regardless of differences in sample size.|Large Number of Categories: Clustered bar charts can accommodate a larger number of categories compared to stacked bar charts, as the bars are grouped together rather than stacked on top of each other.|

|Line chart|Area chart|
|------|-----|
|Line charts represent data points using lines connecting each point |Area charts fill the area under the line, providing a visual representation of cumulative values.|
|Line charts emphasize the continuity and direction of trends.|Area charts emphasize the magnitude of change and cumulative values.|
|Line charts are better for precise trend analysis and identifying individual data point. | Area charts are more suitable for emphasizing overall patterns and proportions.|

|Ribbon chart|Waterfall chart|Funnel chart|
|------|------|-------|
|Comparative Analysis: Ribbon charts are ideal for comparing multiple series or categories across a common axis, such as time.|Showing Cumulative Effect: Waterfall charts are used to illustrate the cumulative effect of sequentially occurring positive and negative values on a starting value.|Sales Pipeline Analysis: Funnel charts are commonly used in sales and marketing to visualize the sales pipeline and track the conversion rates at each stage of the sales process.|
|Data Distribution: They are used to visualize the distribution of data over time or across categories, particularly when the focus is on the relative proportions of each category.|Financial Analysis: They are commonly used in financial analysis to visualize changes in financial data, such as revenue, expenses, and net profit, over time or across categories| Lead Generation: They are effective for visualizing the progression of leads through different stages of the sales or marketing funnel, from initial contact to conversion.|
|Highlighting Trends: Ribbon charts are effective for highlighting trends and patterns in the data, especially when dealing with fluctuating values.|Highlighting Contributions: Waterfall charts are effective for highlighting the contributions of different factors to the overall change in a value, making it easy to identify key drivers of change.|Performance Analysis: Funnel charts help in analyzing the performance of a process or workflow by visualizing the dropout rates or conversion rates at each stage.|
	
|Pie chart| Donut chart|
|-----|----|
|In a pie chart, there is no space in the center, as the entire area is filled with slices representing different categories or data points.|In donut charts there is  presence of a central hole, which can be used to display additional information or simply for aesthetic purposes.|
